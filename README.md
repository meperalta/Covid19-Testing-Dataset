Project 01: COVID-19 Testing Dataset (2021)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
In my COVID-19 Testing Data Analysis project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analytics using Excel. Through meticulous data cleaning, I identified and addressed missing values and removed duplicates, ensuring the integrity of the dataset. Employing data preprocessing techniques, I handled outliers in the temperature column, enhancing the accuracy of the analysis. Transforming numerical values into categorical data facilitated a more insightful exploration of symptoms and demographics. Leveraging Excel's visualization tools, I created a variety of charts, including stacked column charts, line graphs, bar charts, and scatterplots, offering a comprehensive view of the data. The culmination of this work was an interactive dashboard featuring a timeline and slicers for dynamic exploration. This project showcases my ability to navigate and analyze complex datasets, draw meaningful conclusions, and present insights through compelling visualizations, emphasizing my skills as a meticulous and results-driven data analyst.
