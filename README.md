Project 01: COVID-19 Testing Dataset (2021) using Excel
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Â 

Overview:

To derive meaningful insights, a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 testing data, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

Data Cleaning:

Identified missing values and blank rows.
Strategy: Omission - Delete/remove blank rows.
Handled missing values by deleting rows with missing values for specific columns (Temperature, Age, Age 60 and above, Sex, Test Administrator, Patient Experience Survey, Test Type).
Removed duplication using Excel's "Remove Duplicates" function.
Data Preprocessing:

Handled outliers in the Temperature column by replacing values outside the normal range with the median average.
Data Transformation:

Converted numerical values to categorical for columns: Cough, Fever, Sore Throat, Shortness of Breath, Headache, and Contact.
Created an Age Range column based on the Age column.

Data Visualization:

Utilized various Excel charts and graphs for effective visualization:

Pivot Table and Pivot Charts.
Stacked Column Chart for Symptoms & Gender.
Line Graph for Testing Result (Positive - Negative).
2D Vertical Graph for Test Results Distribution by Gender (Age Group - Result).
Scatterplot for Temperature - Result.
Bar Graph for Symptoms - Gender.
Interactive Dashboard:

Created an interactive dashboard with a timeline for date selection.
Implemented slicers for filtering by Gender, Testing Result, Age Group, and Temperature.
Achievements:

Successfully identified and addressed missing values, outliers, and duplicated data.
Transformed numerical values into meaningful categorical data.
Presented insights through a variety of visualizations, making the data easily understandable.
Developed an interactive dashboard for dynamic data exploration.

Tools Used:

Excel for data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, and visualization.
Key Takeaways:

Insights into the distribution of symptoms based on gender.
Trends in testing results over time.
Relationship between temperature and testing results.
Demographic analysis by age group and gender.
